This research project will study how people walk and run in daily life, data is collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) attached to an individualâ€™s feet. 

**Data File**
Raw data includes linear accelerations and angular velocity in all three dimensions. Unfortunately, experimental data is often of low quality with lots of noise and drift.

**Method Used**
1. Labeling Data
2. Transformation of Axis and planes of Motion.
3. Feature Engineering
4. Classifier
